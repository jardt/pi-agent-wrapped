# Verify pi-agent-wrapped changes

Verify behavior, not only compilation. Use a fresh Pi process in a separate Herdr tab when the change affects runtime or TUI behavior.

## Safety and launcher invariants

- First require `HERDR_ENV=1`. If unavailable, run non-interactive checks and report that interactive Herdr verification could not be performed.
- Require `PI_LAUNCHER_BIN` to be set. Fail instead of guessing.
- Spawn Pi only through the exact current `PI_LAUNCHER_BIN` value or `run-current-pi`.
- Never invoke `pi`, `p`, `p-minimal`, `p-sandboxed`, a Nix-built candidate launcher, or another launcher name directly.
- Prefer the absolute `PI_LAUNCHER_BIN` path in Herdr commands because a new pane may not have `run-current-pi` in `PATH`.
- Never control or close the current focused pane. Parse current IDs from Herdr responses; do not guess IDs.

## 1. Identify the verification surface

Inspect:

```sh
git status --short
git diff --check
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Map each changed implementation file to its runtime entry point:

- `extensions/<name>.ts` -> load that file explicitly.
- `extensions/lib/...` -> load the top-level extension(s) importing that module.
- Shared launcher/module/profile/package changes -> run relevant Nix checks, but still spawn Pi only with the active launcher.
- Skill/theme changes -> use explicit `--skill` or `--theme` paths when practical.

Do not accidentally test an installed or Nix-store copy instead of the working-tree file.

## 2. Run deterministic checks first

For extension changes, run:

```sh
npm --prefix extensions run check
git diff --check
```

Run targeted tests for the changed subsystem when available. For Nix changes, prefer the narrowest relevant evaluation/build check, then `nix flake check` when warranted. Stop and fix deterministic failures before interactive testing.

## 3. Create an isolated Herdr test tab

Confirm the environment and discover the focused pane/workspace:

```sh
printf 'HERDR_ENV=%s\nPI_LAUNCHER_BIN=%s\n' "${HERDR_ENV-}" "${PI_LAUNCHER_BIN-}"
herdr pane list
```

Create a non-focused tab in the current workspace with a descriptive label:

```sh
herdr tab create --workspace <workspace-id> --label "verify <feature>" --no-focus
```

Read `result.root_pane.pane_id` and `result.tab.tab_id` from the returned JSON. Use those exact IDs in later calls.

## 4. Launch working-tree code

For extension verification, disable discovered extensions and explicitly load the changed working-tree entry points. This avoids collisions with packaged copies:

```sh
herdr pane run <new-pane-id> "cd <repo-root> && <absolute-PI_LAUNCHER_BIN> --no-extensions -e <repo-root>/extensions/<changed-entry>.ts"
```

Add one `-e` per entry point needed for the test. Include interacting changed extensions when the behavior crosses extension boundaries.

Do not use `run-current-pi` inside the new pane unless its availability there was verified. The authoritative absolute launcher path is preferred.

Wait for startup and inspect output:

```sh
herdr wait output <new-pane-id> --match "pi v" --timeout 30000
herdr pane read <new-pane-id> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 80
herdr pane read <new-pane-id> --source visible --ansi
```

Confirm the `[Extensions]` section names the intended working-tree extensions and no conflicting packaged copy is loaded.

## 5. Exercise the changed behavior

Drive the TUI as a user would:

```sh
herdr pane run <new-pane-id> "<command or prompt>"
herdr wait output <new-pane-id> --match "<expected text>" --timeout 60000
herdr pane read <new-pane-id> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

Use `--source visible --ansi` for placement, color, dimming, borders, wrapping, and other visual claims. Plain text output is insufficient for styling verification.

Test at least:

1. Startup/loading behavior.
2. The primary changed interaction.
3. One failure, disabled, or edge path when relevant.
4. Persistence versus transcript scrolling for UI placement changes.
5. Cleanup/shutdown if the change starts timers, processes, panes, or requests.

For asynchronous tools, wait for both launch and completion output. Read spawned panes when the tool itself creates Herdr splits.

## 6. Compare against the requirement

State concrete evidence:

- Checks run and pass/fail counts.
- Herdr tab and pane used.
- Exact working-tree files loaded.
- User actions sent.
- Relevant observed output and ANSI styling.
- Any behavior not verified and why.

Do not claim success from process startup alone.

## 7. Cleanup

If verification passes and the user did not ask to keep the test UI, close only the created test tab:

```sh
herdr tab close <new-tab-id>
```

On failure, leave the tab open when it contains useful debugging evidence and report its current ID. Remember that Herdr IDs can compact after closes; rediscover IDs before subsequent operations.
